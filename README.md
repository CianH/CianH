### Hi there 👋🏻
Yes, I work at Microsoft. No, I can't fix your Windows 🤗

During my time at MSFT, I've written 
- a lot of C# & XAML for UWP
- quite a bit of Swift for iOS
- some C++ for UWP & Win32
- some C# w/ASP.NET
- a tiny bit of React and Typescript (but that didn't last long 😅).


I enjoy making fully-native client UX that looks and feels great, while feeling "at home" on the platform.
I'm currently working in Swift, while learning SwiftUI and watching way too many WWDC talks.

I also do some Python for scripting, usually doing something with [BeautifulSoup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/).


You can reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zerophyte), feel free to recommend me some awesome Swift or SwiftUI learning resources.
